// CSG layer backed by manifold-3d (Google's Manifold kernel — the engine modern OpenSCAD uses).
// Manifold *guarantees* watertight, 2-manifold output, so the exported STL is clean and prints as
// previewed — mesh-based CSG libraries (three-bvh-csg et al.) leave T-junctions on cut faces that
// slicers report as non-manifold edges.
//
// We build entirely in Manifold space: 2D profiles come from three.js Shapes (convenient for the
// rounded rectangles and the notch slot), but they're extruded with Manifold's own CrossSection
// (Clipper2) rather than three's ExtrudeGeometry — ExtrudeGeometry's ear-clipping can emit
// non-manifold triangulations, and round-tripping a three mesh into Manifold leaks WASM memory.
// The only three.js conversion is the final Manifold -> BufferGeometry for rendering/STL.
//
// Manifold objects live in the WASM heap and are NOT garbage-collected — every intermediate must be
// .delete()d or memory grows per rebuild. `scope()` tracks every solid it creates and frees them all
// in finish(), so callers never juggle lifetimes.
